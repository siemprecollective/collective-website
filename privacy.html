      <h2 id="openingStatement">Opening Statement</h2>

      <p>Siempre does its best to make sure your data is safe and that your privacy is respected.</p>

      <p>This starts with us internally acknowledging and understanding any incentives that we might have that might be misaligned with the health and interests of our users. We then try to minimize or counteract those incentives so that we can systematically be trusted to make the right choices as often as possible. This approach applies not just to our incentives as an organization or as a company, but also as a team and as individuals.</p>

      <p>This attention to our alignment with our users shows up both in our choice of what ideas to pursue and also in the implementation of those ideas. We design our services to use the minimum amount of data needed for us to provide those services and to minimize how much of that data has to pass through our own servers or stay in storage. We also strive to use and design technologies and user interfaces that make it really clear to our users how our systems work.</p>

      <p>Implementing all of this is a never-ending process and we have a lot of work left to do just to reach our current targets for user safety and privacy.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, this page will describe or provide links to the data practices for this website and any of the services that we offer.</p>






      <h2 id="productPolicies">Product-specific Policies</h2>

      <p>The following sections describe policies and practices specific to each of Siempre’s services.</p>

      <h3 id="website">Website</h3>

      <p>Here are some of the data practices used on our main website (everything under the “siempre.io” domain, but not including subdomains like “town.siempre.io” or “video.siempre.io”):</p>

      <ul>
      <li>If you sign up for our mailing list, we store your email so that we can send you updates. Currently, you can remove yourself from the mailing list by emailing us.</li>

      <li>We use Google Analytics on all of our webpages. You can learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes your data on the following page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">“How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.”</a>
        <ul>
        <li>We use Google Analytics to count and log the number of unique visitors on each page of our websites and to understand where that traffic is coming from. Both of these help inform our writing and decision-making so we can provide this service to you..</li>

        <li>We only chose to use Google Analytics after reading through their privacy policy and deciding that it met our standards. If this choice doesn’t meet your standards, you can disable this feature on our websites <a href="#disableCookie">below</a>. If you'd like to disable this feature across your web browser, Google provides an <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">add-on</a> that prevents your data from being used by Google Analytics on other websites. As always, we also welcome you to <a href="mailto:hello@siempre.io">tell us about your concerns.</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>We use a cookie to keep track of votes that you put towards the ideas you like most. This helps us separate out the votes from different users.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We made this list of practices in an effort to be informative beyond the typical legal requirements, so that you get a better picture of how your data is being used. It is not completely exhaustive. Refer to later sections in this document for a more general policy.</p>


      <div id="disableCookie" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-top: 20px;">
        <div class="disable-container">
          If you'd like to disable Google Analytics on "siempre.io" and all its subdomains ("town.siempre.io", "video.siempre.io"), just click here:
          <div id="disable-button">
            Disable
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>



      <h3 id="onlineTown">Online Town</h3>

      <p>Here are some of our data practices that we use for Online Town, specifically:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>We keep track of what rooms have been created as part of the implementation of the room functionality. This includes the following metadata:
      <ul>
        <li>Which map that room was created with</li>
        <li>The unique URL for that room</li>
        <li>Whether or not it is password-protected</li>
        <li>A salted hash of the room password</li>
      </ul>
      </li>

      <li>We count and log the number of people in every room, and count and log how many people have visited the site in total. This helps us understand the usage of Online Town, which helps us in understanding what work to prioritize.</li>

      <li>We use cookies to store small bits of information, like the name you set in a room, or whether or not you’ve indicated that you’re over 18. This lets us persist that information across usage sessions, so that you don’t have to enter it multiple times.</li>

      <li>If you use our feedback form, we store your message, along with your name and email if you provide them. This lets us read and respond to your feedback</li>

      <li>We use Google Analytics on Online Town. See our explanation of what we use it for under the <a href="#website">Website section</a> above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We made this list of practices in an effort to be informative beyond the typical legal requirements, so that you get a better picture of how your data is being used. It might not be completely exhaustive. Refer to later sections in this document for a more general policy.</p>






      <h3 id="siempreVideo">Siempre Video</h3>

      <p>In “Siempre Video” (“video.siempre.io” and its corresponding desktop and mobile apps) we DO NOT store or have access to any video/audio streams from our users: these connections are established peer-to-peer and not through a central server. From a technical standpoint, each app instance communicates to a central server that helps establish direct connections between the devices through which all video/audio streams go through.</p>

      <p>However, we DO have access to video/audio messages sent between users. These messages are stored on our central server and not peer-to-peer because the sender needs to be able to send a message even if the recipient’s device is not online to receive it. For a similar reason, we also store profile pictures in our central server.</p>

      <p>We log some information in the providing of the service. We use this information to understand the usage of and improve our apps. This includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Status changes (e.g. changing from “busy” to “available”) and who performed them, and at what date</li>

        <li>Each instance of a user joining/exiting a call, at what time it happened, and whether or not it was a “private call”</li>

        <li>Video/audio messages, who the sender/recipient are, and at what time it was sent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Additionally, our database contains other information that isn’t logged anywhere. That is, there is no record of this information beyond its current state. However, this does mean that any of the developers of Siempre Video can go into the database and see what this information is at that point in time. This information is used to provide core functionality to our service. These include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Each user’s status, text status, list of friends, list of friends they have “enabled,” and whether or not they have a device with an internet connection to our servers.</li>

        <li>A list of currently unresolved friend requests</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We made this list of practices in an effort to be informative beyond the typical legal requirements, so that you get a better picture of how your data is being used. It is not completely exhaustive. Refer to later sections in this document for a more general policy.</p>



      <h2 id="generalPolicies">General Policies</h2>
